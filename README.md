# Project Title
*Wu-Tang Clan*

##Getting Started

After downloading my file, download the node dependencies and the npm figlet. Then you may run the server.js

##Prerequisites

I use a MAC, and i use Atom as my Text editor. You can find the npm at *https://www.npmjs.com/*.

##Installing

First click on the clone or download button on the top right on my repository.
 Then copy the HTTPS URL. Then type git clone on your MAC terminal that you can open using command spacebar and type terminal.
 After typing git clone, paste the URL there and press enter. After it finishes downloading, open it up with atom to see all the code.
 Then on your terminal after you have downloaded all the npm dependencies and figlet you can try running it.
First cd into the folder using the terminal, then type node server.js to run the file under the local server.
You should be able to see the program running now.
